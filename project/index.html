        <h2> About </h2>
        <p> We here at The Shesha Project are students, and like students
        worldwide we are tired of how unpleasant online textbooks are to use.
        We decided we have had enough, and that's why we are making Shesha,
        a modern, friction-less online learning platform. </p>

    <section id="features">
        <h2> Features </h2>
        <p> We live in a world of virtual reality, international shopping, and
        infinite information, all available with a few keystrokes. Yet, online
        textbooks still look, feel, and operate like sites from the 1990's.
        Shesha will not be repeating these mistakes. </p>
