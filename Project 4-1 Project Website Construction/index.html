            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Sesha is a website designed as a replacement for pack in DVDs
            for educational materials, as most people’s computers don’t have
            DVD players anymore. Sales are handled by course publishers and
            they merely pay us to cover hosting costs. This is to be more
            publisher-friendly while also providing a trusted site for
            users.</p> <p>An example course would be a guitar book sold with a
            qr code linking to our website hosting supplemental recordings of
            the instructor showing finger positions. Another course might be a
            DVD material course translated into a web page, with categories and
            links to the PDFs related to each video.</p> <p>For the educators
            there is optionally a code system to allow their content to be
            locked off. Having gated content gives the option to host videos
            locally, whereas if the content accessible with only a link the
            content is hosted on YouTube for bandwidth management purposes. For
            now there will be only basic templates for the instructors to
            use.</p> <p>For users, the site is designed to be accessed directly
            through the link provided by the educators. If the course requires
            a code an account will be created, and the users will have access
            to all courses purchased on this service through that link. They
            will have the option to input the code from the book or buy a code
            from the educator if their code has been used and the educator
            wishes that restriction. Otherwise logging in will be optional and
            shouldn’t be intrusive.</p>
